#Key Steps for Problem Solving
1. Define your problem
2. Make sure you fully understand the problem
3. Break the problem down into small and manageable pieces 
4. Go as deep as you can, until you can get to easy (yes or no) questions
5. Work your way from the bottom until the problem is solved
6. Recognise some problems are completely out of your control and that's ok.
